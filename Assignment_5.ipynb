    "The concept of delegation is a design principle in object-oriented programming where one object forwards or delegates some of its responsibilities to another object. In delegation, an object, known as the delegator or wrapper, holds a reference to another object, known as the delegate. When the delegator receives a method call, it forwards the request to the delegate to handle the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of inheriting behavior directly from a superclass, a class can delegate certain tasks to another class that specializes in those tasks. This promotes a more flexible and decoupled design, as changes to the delegate don't necessarily affect the delegator and vice versa."

Composition allows you to create more complex classes by composing or aggregating multiple objects rather than inheriting from them.
