    "The purpose of the try statement in Python is to enable exception handling. The try statement allows you to define a block of code that might raise exceptions during its execution. By placing code inside a try block, you can detect and handle exceptions in a controlled manner, preventing the program from terminating abruptly and providing a way to recover from exceptional situations."

    "The assert statement in Python is used to test whether a given expression is True. If the expression is False, the assert statement raises an AssertionError exception, which indicates that the condition being checked is not satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assert statement is similar to the if statement, particularly when the assert statement is used to perform preconditions checks. The primary difference is that assert is used for debugging and should not be used for handling expected errors in the program's logic. As a result, it is often disabled in production mode, and the if statement is used for general conditional logic."

However, the with/as statement offers a more concise and elegant way to manage resources and is specifically designed for this purpose"
