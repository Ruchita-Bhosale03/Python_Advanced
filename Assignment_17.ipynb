It tries to consume as few characters as possible and gives up characters if needed to find other valid matches.\n",

    "A capturing group is a part of a regular expression pattern enclosed in parentheses (e.g., (pattern)). When a match is found, the content matched by the capturing group is stored in memory and can be accessed later using backreferences or special variables.\n",

    "On the other hand, a non-capturing group is also enclosed in parentheses but starts with ?: (e.g., (?:pattern)). It behaves like a regular capturing group in terms of matching the specified pattern, but it does not create a separate memory capture for the matched content. It is useful when you want to group a part of the pattern for quantification or alternation without needing to store the matched content for later use.\n",
