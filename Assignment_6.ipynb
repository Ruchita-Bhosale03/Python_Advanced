    "Exception processing, also known as exception handling, is a powerful feature in programming that allows you to gracefully handle and recover from unexpected or exceptional situations during the execution of a program. Here are three essential applications for exception processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Error Handling and Robustness:\n",
    "One of the primary applications of exception processing is error handling. It enables you to deal with various types of errors that might occur during program execution, such as file I/O errors, network errors, division by zero, and many others. By catching and handling exceptions, you can prevent your program from crashing and provide meaningful error messages or fallback behavior, enhancing the overall robustness and stability of your application.\n"

When you expect specific input formats or valid data ranges, you can use exception handling to catch invalid inputs or data that doesn't meet the required criteria. This way, you can prompt the user for correct input or take appropriate actions to ensure the data's validity before processing it further."

    "When an exception occurs in your script, you have several options for recovering from it and responding gracefully to the exceptional situation. These options involve using exception handling constructs to catch, handle, and recover from exceptions. In Python, the primary mechanism for exception handling is the try-except block.\n",

    "1) Using try-except blocks:\n",
    "You can use a try-except block to catch and handle specific exceptions. Inside the try block, you place the code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs, the execution jumps to the corresponding except block, where you can handle the exceptional situation, take corrective actions, or display relevant error messages. \n",
