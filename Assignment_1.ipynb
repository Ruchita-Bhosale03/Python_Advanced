    "1)Modularity and Reusability: OOP allows you to break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable objects or classes\n",
    "2)Encapsulation: OOP supports encapsulation, which is the bundling of data and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation hides the internal details of an object and provides a clean interface for interacting with it.\n",
    "3)Inheritance: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows you to define a new class based on an existing class, inheriting its attributes and methods.\n",
    "4)Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as interchangeable entities, as long as they adhere to a common interface or share a common base class.\n",
    "5)Code Organization and Maintainability: OOP provides a structured approach to code organization, making it easier to understand, modify, and maintain large codebases. "

    "In Python, when you access an attribute (such as a variable or a method) on an object, the inheritance search looks for the attribute in a specific order, known as the method resolution order (MRO). The MRO determines the sequence in which Python searches for attributes in a class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The instance itself: Python first checks if the attribute exists in the instance object itself. If found, it is immediately returned.\n",

    "Ancestors and their order: If the attribute is not found in the instance's class, Python continues searching in the ancestor classes according to their order in the MRO.

    "n Python, the first argument in a class's method function is conventionally named self, although you can technically choose any name for it.
