    "The change in string types in Python 3.X from using ASCII by default to using Unicode (str type) as the default string type has a significant effect on code.\n",
    "unicode Support: The most notable effect is that strings in Python 3.X (str type) are Unicode by default, which means they can handle characters from any language and support a wide range of characters, including emojis and special symbols. This simplifies working with multilingual text and ensures better compatibility with various data sources.\n",
